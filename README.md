# emacs init files
Bart Massey 2023

This is the most goshawful collection of stuff that my
`emacs` currently loads. Cannot recommend.

See `dotemacs.el` for what to put in your top-level
`.emacs`. Then put this stuff in `$HOME/etc/emacs` and you
should be good to go.

This is unsupported, contains old versions of `emacs`
standard tools, and is highly idiosyncratic. If you must use
it, please read it carefully and edit to taste.
